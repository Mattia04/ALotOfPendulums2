# A Lot Of Pendulums 2

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License%20-%20MIT%20-%20green?style=flat-square)


In this project I will simulate the double pendulum to create the double pendulum fractal.

This repository is the continuation of [this repo](https://github.com/Mattia04/a-Lot-of-Pendulums), I have decided to create another repository because to implement GPU acceleration I had to write the code from zero again, so I choose to keep the two separate.

---

## Roadmap

- write the double pendulum system, with a function to log the energy.
- check which integrator is the optimal to use.
- create the code to generate the HDF5 file.
- optimize the code using GPU acceleration.
